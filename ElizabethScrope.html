 Elizabeth "Isabel" de St John formerly Scrope aka Bigod, Rochford. Born about 1439 in Bolton, Lancashire, England <br>
    The Scropes were an important North Yorkshire family who spent a lot of time on the borders fighting the Scots.
Elizabeth married three times. Elizabeth Scope had been married firstly to John Bigod of Settrington. He died as a result of injuries sustained at the Battle of Towton in 1461. She then married Henry Rochford who died in 1470 though whether it was from natural causes or a nasty case of soldiering is unknown. When Elizabeth died in 1503 she was buried next to husband number two in Stoke Rochford. Her third marriage was to Oliver St John.<br>
<br>
Elizabeth's brother had married Elizatbeth St John - Oliver's Sister. He was John Scrope, Baron Scrope of Bolton (Bolton Castle in Wensleydale) and another good Yorkist.<br>
